Resources

-  Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
-  Analysis - Supporting visual documentation Fig. 1 through Fig. 7, Pyber_fare_summary.png 
-  Software: Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of the analysis

The company V. Isualize has given us the task of creating a summary of the total DataFrame of the ride-sharing data for Pyber by three city types - Rural, Urban and Suburban. This will include a multiple-line graph that will show the total weekly fares for each city type.


#### The analysis calculated the following:

- Total fares for each city type. 
- Average fare per driver for each city type
- Average fare per ride for each city type
- Total number of rides
- Total number of drivers 


### Results

The results of the analysis yielded the following:

- Suburban cities: 625 rides 
- rural cities: 125 rides 
- Urban cities: 1,625 rides

- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride 
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride
- Rural cities have the least number of rides, drivers, and total fares.
- Urban cities have the greatest number of rides, drivers, and total fares.


Our result show that the total in fares dollars where highest in urban cities. For all the cities greatest amounts of fares was at the end of the month of February. The month of April showed the fares declined for the rural and urban areas but increase in the suburban areas. The drivers in the rural making almost the amount in fares versus the other city fares.


## Summary

Our result show that the total in fares dollars where highest in urban cities. For all the cities greatest amounts of fares was at the end of the month of February. The month of April showed the fares declined for the rural and urban areas but increase in the suburban areas. The drivers in the rural making almost the amount in fares versus the other city fares.

The data we retrieved can be used for PYBer to implement the following: 

-  Increasing the fares in the urban cities to compensate drivers versus the rural cities city drivers 
-  A follow up analysis to find out if there is an unmet need for drivers in the rural areas and how to incentivize drives to meet these needs
-  Advertise for drivers in all cities during non-peak months
